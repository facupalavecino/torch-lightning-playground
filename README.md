# Football Players Recognizer

Dummy project where I play around with [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/pytorch-lightning).

We do that by implementing an Image Segmentation model capable of recognizing football players in images.

The dataset has been downloaded from Kaggle [(⚽ Football Player Segmentation ⚽)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ihelon/football-player-segmentation). I took inspiration, and even copied some preprocessing functions, from this Kaggle notebook: [Football Player Segmentation with U-Net](https://www.kaggle.com/code/weigelk/football-player-segmentation-with-u-net).

The implementation of the U-Net model has been copied from the following repo: [PyTorch-UNet](https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet/blob/67bf11b4db4c5f2891bd7e8e7f58bcde8ee2d2db/unet/unet_model.py#L8), which is linked from this webpage: [U-Net](https://paperswithcode.com/method/u-net).
